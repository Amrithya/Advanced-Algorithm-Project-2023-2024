# Ant Colony Algorithm Module

## Introduction
This module is a part of a computational project focused on optimization problems, specifically utilizing the Ant Colony Algorithm. It's particularly applied to problems involving path finding or graph traversal.

## Features
- `ant_colony_algorithm_no_constraint.py`: Implements the algorithm without specific constraints, suitable for general path finding.
- `ant_colony_algorithm_with_constraint.py`: Adjusted to solve constrained path-finding problems.

## Problem Description
The Ant Colony Algorithm simulates the behavior of ants in finding paths from their colony to food sources. It's a probabilistic technique that can efficiently solve traversal problems in graphs or networks.

## Installation
Python 3.x is required. After cloning the repository, navigate to the `ant_colony_algorithm` directory. Install any necessary dependencies as outlined in the root project.

## Usage
To apply the Ant Colony Algorithm, import the module and provide the necessary data. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
from ant_colony_algorithm_no_constraint import ant_colony_algorithm

# Example graph or network data
graph_data = [...]

# Run the algorithm
path = ant_colony_algorithm(graph_data)
